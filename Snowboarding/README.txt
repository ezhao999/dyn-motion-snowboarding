Snowboard Adventures

Team 1 Dynamic Motion and Game Experience
(Jessica Lee, Eric Zhao, Ruoming Xin, Jiaqi Wang)

Our final project centers around a VR snowboarding game, 
where the player controls their snowboard through a 
skateboard, longboard, or other tilting platform in 
real life.

The goal of the game is to avoid the yeti chasing you down
the mountain, by riding down as fast as possible without
losing control or crashing into the slope's many obstacles.

To play, first mount your left Quest controller upside-down
on your chosen tilting platform, with the tracking ring flat
on the surface, and the trigger button facing straight away
from you. 

The left controller therefore only controls your movement
in game, while the right controller is for navigating menus
and resetting the game. 

Left Control Scheme:

1) Tilt left and right -> turn board

Right Control Scheme:

1) A -> Calibrate board, navigate UI, reset run
2) B -> Recalibrate board and reset run
